# 8-puzzle-game-solver
In this assignment an agent will be implemented to solve the 8-puzzle game using (bfs,dfs,A*)</br></br>
An instance of the 8-puzzle game consists of a board holding 8 distinct movable tiles, plus
an empty space. For any such board, the empty space may be legally swapped with any tile
horizontally or vertically adjacent to it. In this assignment, the blank space is going to be
represented with the number 0.
Given an initial state of the board, the search problem is to find a sequence of moves that transitions
this state to the goal state; that is, the configuration with all tiles arranged in ascending
order 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 .
The search space is the set of all possible states reachable from the initial state. The blank
space may be swapped with a component in one of the four directions ’Up’, ’Down’, ’Left’,
’Right’, one move at a time. The cost of moving from one configuration of the board to another
is the same and equal to one. Thus, the total cost of path is equal to the number of moves
made from the initial state to the goal state.</br></br>
The output will be:
1. path to goal
2. cost of path
3. nodes expanded
4. search depth
5. running time
